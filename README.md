# MCardStudentOrgSignUp

Idea:
Sign up to a student org by only swiping your MCard.
+ Helpful uniquname validator for when people type in their names for signing up

Prompt/Purpose:
Come Fall/WinterFest, many people have to line up to sign up for clubs and student orgs because of long lines to those computers. Instead of students trying to type in their uniquname individually on a crowded computer, just swipe their MCard instead. All the data would be stored safely and accurately.

Security:
There is information that is very sensitive on mcards, so the programs will only record, uniqunames and Name.
